Are you encountering BSODs (Blue Screen of Death) due to a problematic CrowdStrike driver? Here's a quick guide on how to fix this issue using a PowerShell script. By following these steps, you can safely delete the problematic driver file and revert your system back to normal mode.

Step-by-Step Solution
Identify the Problematic Driver:
Ensure you know the exact path and name of the driver file causing the issue. In this example, it is assumed to be C-00000291*.sys in the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\ directory.
Execute the Script:
Save the script as CrowdStrikeFix.ps1.
Open PowerShell as Administrator.
Run the script using the command:
powershell
Copy code
.\CrowdStrikeFix.ps1
Key Points
Administrative Privileges: Ensure PowerShell is run as an Administrator to modify boot settings and delete system files.
Execution Policy: Adjust the PowerShell execution policy if necessary:
powershell
Copy code
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
Rebooting: The script will reboot the system into Safe Mode and back to Normal Mode.
By following these steps, you can resolve BSOD issues caused by a problematic CrowdStrike driver efficiently. This approach minimizes downtime and ensures your system returns to normal operations quickly.
